# Privacy Policy for WeqaCalc

**Last Updated: October 29, 2025**

WeqaCalc ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our WeqaCalc mobile application (the "Service").

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be clear: **WeqaCalc does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive user data.** This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Personal Identifiable Information:** We do not ask for your name, email address, phone number, or any other information that could identify you.
*   **Financial Data:** All financial calculations and data you input (e.g., loan amounts, interest rates, investment figures, retirement goals) are processed *locally on your device only*. This data is never sent to our servers, stored in any external database, or shared with any third party.
*   **Usage Data:** We do not collect information about how you use the app, such as features accessed, frequency of use, or duration of sessions.
*   **Device Information:** We do not collect device-specific information such as your device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, or mobile network information.
*   **Location Data:** WeqaCalc does not access or track your device's location.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect any personal or sensitive information from our users, **we do not use your information in any way.** The app's functionality is entirely self-contained on your device, providing calculations without any need for data transmission or external processing.

## 3. Permissions

The WeqaCalc application is designed to function without requiring any intrusive permissions. It does not request or access:

*   Your contacts
*   Your camera or microphone
*   Your photo gallery or media files
*   Your precise or approximate location
*   Your device storage (beyond what is necessary for the app to install and run)
*   Network access (except for initial app download and updates from app stores)

## 4. Third-Party Services

WeqaCalc does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or other services that would collect information from you. Our commitment is to provide a purely local and private calculator experience.

## 5. Data Security

While we do not collect or store your data, we are committed to ensuring that the app itself is secure. All data you input remains on your device, protected by your device's security features.

## 6. Children's Privacy

WeqaCalc is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under 13, we will delete such information from our records.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
